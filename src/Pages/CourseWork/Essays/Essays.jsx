                    the code) locally without messing up each otherâ€™s work.

                    Query is a utility library of JavaScript code that enables
                    front-end developers to build web pages and web apps
                    effortlessly. This library provides quick solutions for
                    simple problems such as straightforward web pages and web
                    apps.

                    React is a library that allows for embedding HTML within
                    JavaScript. It provides a reusable library code that cuts
                    down on the total development time and also shortens the
                    scope of errors. React uses JSX, an XML like syntax
                    extension for Javascript to reduce complexity when coding
                    websites, and uses virtual DOM.
